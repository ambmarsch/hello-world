This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

With over two decades of experience in data analytics, intelligence, and business processes, I am an accomplished data manager and advisor who has delivered value and insights to various sectors, including energy/oil and gas, commercial real estate, and business services. My core competencies include project and product management, business development, and relationship management, as well as data quality, governance, and stewardship frameworks and tools.

Most recently, I worked at ExxonMobil's Upstream Data Office, where I used my Microsoft Power BI certification and Agile, SAFe, Scrum, and Waterfall methodologies to plan, execute, and monitor data governance and data product initiatives. I also led the SSHE data management team and implemented data standards and harmonization across the Unconventional business organization, resulting in automation and FTE reduction. My mission is to help organizations harness the power of data and drive innovation and growth.
